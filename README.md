Jeoparty
========

This is an individual project trying my hand at ios development with a simple concept

This is basically a virtual board game version of the gameshow Jeopardy, meant to be played
with a group of people in a party or classroom setting. One person creates the questions and answers
and acts as the host, while the other players play the game. The app is for iPad and supports create,
play, and edit features for the games.
